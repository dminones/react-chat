## Chat

Create a Chat Web App that implements the following features:

- Basic user login
- Real-time messages
- List of connected users
- Chat history

The UI should allow the user to send messages, view channel messages and display the list of connected users.

After disconnecting and reconnecting, the user should be able to see the last 10 messages for that channel.

The app must be compatible with the last 2 versions of Chrome and Firefox.

### You should stick to the following tech stack:
- Javascript (Typescript is considered a plus)
- Node.js
- React + JSX

Any other language, technology, library, module, framework or persistence solution is _optional_.

### Features that will be considered a plus:

- Markdown support or Giphy integration
- User real-time events. Eg: “User X disconnected”, “User Z is typing…” 

Please share your code on Github with instructions on how to build and run the app. Deploy to Heroku if possible.
